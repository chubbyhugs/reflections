How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

I was able to quickly see the differences without having to parse through the entire files line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Less time will be spent perform the mundane things like finding file differences.  More time
can be spent on development.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros of manually commit
No need to learn version control software tools.

Cons of manually doing a commit:
that you have to copy all or part of your project and maintain the order
diskspace usage increases greatly
not easy to see what changes were made, this will require a diff on potentially more than one file
workload to orgainze and maintain the order is greater.
Others cannot see your changes unless the files/project are stored on a shared drive or 

Pros of automatic commits:
Easy to create a commit.
Version control software does the heavy work for you.
Easy to revert back and see changes.
Less diskspace usage.  
Others can see your changes.

Cons
Need to learn version control software tools..


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Google Docs is used to create and edit word documents and the changes are made one file at a time.
Source code changes tend to occur across one or more files so Git allows for this.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log allows shows the commit history
git diff shows the actual changes made to the specific files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Knowing that you can always revert back to a previous working state allows you the freedom to experiment with changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Creating new branches, editing text, and committing.


What happens when you initialize a repository ? Why do you need to do it?

Git installs a hidden .git folder and sets up the git database structure (metadata).
So that Git can track file changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
The staging area contains the files that will be included in the next commit.

What value do you think it offers?
The ability easily identify the files that changed and the ability to revert them back to their
original condition.
