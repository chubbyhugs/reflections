When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with others.  This sharing can be one way or two way depending on what type of project you are working on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you don't introduce changes that could conflict with what you are working on.
